# Data Analysis
This project works through data analysis concepts and techniques from a course on www.suanlab.com. The materials cover core data analysis skills that apply to any field or industry.

## Course Chapters
1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Initial investigation into datasets. Counting values, finding distributions, spotting outliers, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing - Formatting, cleaning and restructuring data before analysis.
3.Data Cleaning - Identifying and fixing issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, etc.
4. Data Integration - Combining two or more datasets together. Requires ensuring the data can be merged, handling overlap, etc.
5. Data Reduction - Using summarization, aggregation, dimension reduction, etc. to make datasets smaller and more manageable.
6. Data Transformation - Changing the form, structure or scale of data to suit your needs. Log transforms, scaling, binning, etc.
7. Feature Engineering - Creating new features from raw data to use in models.
8. OpenRefine - Tool for data cleaning and transformation.
9. NumPy - Library for scientific computing in Python. Used for statistics, matrices, and more.
10. Pandas - Library for data analysis and manipulation in Python. Built on NumPy.
11. Exploring and Visualization of Titanic Dataset - Putting the skills into action on the Titanic Kaggle dataset.

## Code and Tools
The course uses:
Colab
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
OpenRefine

The projects analyze and visualize various public datasets to demonstrate concepts and techniques.

I found this course very helpful for building a basic foundation in qualitative and quantitative data analysis using Python. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improving my data analysis skills!
